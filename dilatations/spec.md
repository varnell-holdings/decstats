I want to write a python program.
Please look at claude.md and episodes.csv
Terminal based program.
"welcome to Dilatation Counter"
input year
input January-June or July-December

columns in episodes.csv of interest 'date' format DD-MM-YYY and 'upper'

we simply want to count the number of entries in 
'upper' with the value "30475"

At the end the program will out put to the terminal The number of dilatations performed in the period **** was - such and such.

Addition for new session: I now want the program to count the number of non empty entries in the 'upper' column as well and add this to the output with a line like 'The number of upper endoscopies performed in the period **** was - such and such.
Thanks
