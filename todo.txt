BACKEND CAECUM REPORTING SORT OUT


***** = ACTIONS in docbill_start



1. ****   change fail_text  to fail_text_label   everywhere  -  more descriptive

2. ****  line 1586  caecum_flag = caecum.get()  change to  caecum_reason = caecum.get()

3. ***** line 2090  get rid of "" empty string as an option


line 1515

        colon = co.get()

        if colon == "Cancelled":
            message += "Colon cancelled."
        if colon == "Non Rebatable":
            message += "Colon done but Non Rebatable."
        if colon == "Failure to reach caecum":
            caecum_flag = "fail"
            message += "Short colon only"
        else:
            caecum_flag = "success"
        colon = COLON_DIC[colon]

this code sets caecum_flag even if no colon was done!!
note if colon was not done co.get() should return  "No Lower"




4. ***** set line 1480  caecum_flag = False
5. ****** change above code to

line 1515

        colon = co.get()

        if colon == "Cancelled":
            message += "Colon cancelled."
        elif colon == "Non Rebatable":
            message += "Colon done but Non Rebatable."
        elif colon == "Failure to reach caecum":
            caecum_flag = "fail"
            message += "Short colon only"
        elif colon[0:3] == "322":
            caecum_flag = "success"
        
        colon = COLON_DIC[colon]



6. LINE 1832  ***** CHANGE

        if colon:
            caecum_data(endoscopist, mrn, caecum_flag)

            TO

        if caecum_flag:
            caecum_to_csv(doctor, mrn, caecum_flag, caecum_reason)



7. line 908  **** change definition  of function  caecum_data to

def caecum_to_csv(doctor, mrn, caecum_flag, caecum_reason):
    """Write whether scope got to caecum."""
    doctor = doctor.split()[-1]
    today_str = today.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
    caecum_data = (today_str, doctor, mrn, caecum_flag, reason)
    update_csv(caecum_csv_file, caecum_data, today_str, mrn) # caecum_csv_file is defined at line 79


8.   ******   line 26   insert  
from tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile
import shutil


9. *******   line 79   caecum_csv_file = "d:\\JOHN TILLET\\source\\caecum\\caecum.csv"
